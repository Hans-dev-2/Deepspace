# ===== Wrist Cue Event System (Condensed) =====

# Step 1 — Wrist Cue Types
${wrist_cues} = [
    "resource_detected", "enemy_sensor", "data_signal",
    "equipment_alert", "environment_hazard", "npc_activity",
    "loot_hint", "mission_update"
]

# Step 2 — Trigger Conditions
# Cues appear randomly during travel, exploration, encounters, or milestones

# Step 3 — Narrative Prompts
# AI generates subtle cues:
# "Wrist vibrates; sensors detect mineral density." → resource_detected
# "Red alert flashes: enemy patrol ahead." → enemy_sensor
# "Encrypted data received. Use wrist:data to decode." → data_signal
# "Medkit blinks: injuries detected." → equipment_alert
# "Radiation spike ahead; analyze route." → environment_hazard
# "Faction officer on deck; interaction may reveal intel." → npc_activity
# "Hidden crate nearby; faint sensor signature." → loot_hint
# "Mission update: HQ requests report." → mission_update

# Step 4 — Player Options
# Each cue suggests actions: wrist:<command>, inventory:check, investigate, move, interact, fight
# Player may ignore; cues persist or evolve

# Step 5 — Dynamic Integration
# AI links cues to loot, environment, intel, or mini-encounters
# Multiple cues can overlap for complex story dynamics

# Example:
# Player travels → AI rolls wrist_cues[random] → resource_detected
# Narrative: "Your wrist computer vibrates gently. Scans show faint mineral signatures ahead."
# Suggested actions: wrist:scan, investigate, move
